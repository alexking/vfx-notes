Well despite the lack of updates, the [month of modeling project][mom] went great. It turned out to be way too much work to render out a new video each week, but I was always able to get something modeled (well except during [PAX][pax]). I think it helped a ton. 
 
I just finished this model of a bike, which I think is the largest thing I've modeled so far - check it out!
