<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At every convention I attend someone will ask me how to get better at drawing. The answer is draw every day and never be satisfied with the result.&rdquo;

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to become better at using Blender, and the skill I&rsquo;ve found most lacking lately has been my modeling. So this month, I decided to model something every day, as quickly and with as much detail as possible. They say practice makes perfect right? I&rsquo;m not holding myself to making materials and textures for everything, but I&rsquo;m adding them when I have time, since it&rsquo;s a bit more fun.</p>

<p>I had originally planned to make a post every day with a video of each model (just a quick turntable render). They&rsquo;d be so short though, I decided to make one video per week, with all the models aggregated. So check out the video from the first week below.</p>

<p>Includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Sat</code> Amanda&rsquo;s Knife from the first episode of Hendstrom</li>
<li><code>Sun</code> Small Potion Bottle (modeled after one we found on vacation)</li>
<li><code>Mon</code> Burger (with this one I decided to build new objects for the scene each day)</li>
<li><code>Tue</code> Burger Box</li>
<li><code>Wed</code> Fast Food Cup with Straw</li>
</ul>


<p>So please keep checking back in for new videos, hopefully you can watch me start to get better at making some geometry.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>One of the resources I&rsquo;ve found extremely helpful in trying to learn Blender modeling is <a href="http://cgcookie.com">CGCookie</a>. I&rsquo;d highly recommend them, they&rsquo;re even worth getting a subscription to. My favorite courses on modeling so far have been <a href="http://cgcookie.com/blender/cgc-series/weapon-modeling-an-m4/">this one on hard surface modeling</a> and <a href="http://cgcookie.com/blender/cgc-courses/piero/">this one on modeling a bird</a>.</p>
