      <title>Month of Modeling</title>
      <link>http://vfx.alexnking.com/blender/2013/08/07/month-of-modeling.html</link>
      <description>&gt; &quot;At every convention I attend someone will ask me how to get better at drawing. The answer is draw every day and never be satisfied with the result.&quot;
&gt; â€“ [Gabe from Penny Arcade][pa]
 
I've been trying to become better at using Blender, and the skill I've found most lacking lately has been my modeling. So this month, I decided to model something every day, as quickly and with as much detail as possible. They say practice makes perfect right? I'm not holding myself to making materials and textures for everything, but I'm adding them when I have time, since it's a bit more fun.
